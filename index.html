								<h1><strong>Benjamin Montet</strong></h1>
							</header>
                            <p>Hi there! I'm a Scientia Associate Professor in the <a href=https://phys.unsw.edu.au>School of Physics</a> at the University of New South Wales, where I lead
								the <a href="https://newts.space">NEarby Worlds and Their Stars (NEWTS)</a> group. That link takes you to our group's webpage.
                            Our research group is focused on finding and understanding new planets orbiting stars other than the Sun, and developing new methods to better understand how
                                stellar activity changes across stellar lifetimes. To do these, we use data from the NASA <i>Kepler</i> and <i>TESS</i> missions, as well as from
                                ground-based facilities in Australia and abroad.
                            </p>
                            <p>I'm always happy to discuss potential projects with students at all levels from undergraduate to Ph.D. If you're a current or prospective UNSW student,
                                feel free to reach out to me to discuss potential projects or research directions. My email is b.montet [at] unsw.edu.au. </p>

                                <h3>Long-Term Photometric Variability of Stars</h3>
                                    <p><i>Kepler</i> has measured short-term variations in the observed flux of hundreds of thousands of stars
                                    as a part of its search for exoplanets. During this search, signs of long-term variability
                                    in the stars are intentionally destroyed. Full-frame image (FFI) data from <i>Kepler</i> provide
                                    an opportunity to recover this variability to better measure long-term photometric variations.
                                    We've developed <a href="http://github.com/benmontet/f3">a method</a> to do just that, 
                                    which we've applied to <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...830L..39M">KIC 8462852</a> to understand its 
                                    environment and to 5,000 <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...851..116M">Sun-like stars</a> to understand their starspot and facular coverage.
                                    I'm excited about applying this to a larger sample of stars, and combining it with observations of stars over
										longer time baselines, such as with <i>TESS</i>, <i>Roman</i>, and the Rubin Observatory,
										to understand how stellar fundamental parameters
                                    affect the magnitude and
                                    evolution of stellar activity, and the implications for planetary habitability.

								<h3>Planetary Dynamics with TESS</h3>
								<p>The NASA <i>TESS</i> mission has provided us with data on millions of stars, many of which host orbiting planets.
									<i>TESS</i> has now observed for longer than the primary <i>Kepler</i> mission, enabling transit and eclipse timing
									variations to become apparent in this dataset. With the large Full-Frame Images from this mission, there is still
									a lot to explore.
                                We are searching these FFIs to find new planets, both through their transits and through the dynamical signatures
									they <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...981..106M/">impart on their neighbours</a>.
									In the future, I'm interested in developing machine learning techniques to characterize planetary signals and find
									signs of dynamical perturbations in planetary systems that can be used in both the TESS dataset and upcoming transit surveys.

								<h3>Searching for Circumbinary Planets via Apsidal Precession</h3>
								<p> The <i>Kepler</i> and <i>TESS</i> telescopes have combined to find more than a dozen circumbinary planets, which orbit
									around two stars instead of only one. These planets provide the opportunity to understand how planetary
									systems form and evolve in dynamically complex environments, and can inform observations of similarly
									complex systems, such as those in resonant configurations around single stars.
									Those circumbinary planets have all previously been found by the transit method, limiting us to systems that are
									coplanar between the orbital axis of the host binary and the planet itself.
									We have approached the search for these planets in a different direction, searching for signatures of apsidal precession
									in stellar eclipsing binaries which must be caused by a third body in the system. While the precession signal itself
									could be caused by third star or other object (maybe even a black hole), with careful RV monitoring we can determine which
									systems likely host planets.
									We've begun this work and recently announced our first tranche of
									<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv251207934T/abstract">possible planet candidates</a>, and are
									now extending this work to include new data and to begin following up our candidates.
									We have recently been awarded an Australian Research Council Discovery
									Project grant to do this project, and are happy to collaborate with others on these projects.
