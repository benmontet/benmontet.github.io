<h1>Australian Time Domain Astronomy Unconference</h1>
<h3>2-6 September 2024 / University of New South Wales / Sydney, NSW</h3>

<p>

This workshop is designed to bring together a group of people with a common
interest in scientific discovery via time-series observations, broadly defined.

It is intended to build new collaborations, facilitate the development of
    new projects, minimize duplication of
effort, and enhance the transfer of knowledge and methodology between
    disparate subfields.
    Participants should be interested in trying new ideas, working with
    different datasets, and exploring new opportunities over the
    week-long event.
This is not a traditional scientific conference and there will not be any formal
talks.
Instead, time will be devoted to informal discussions and co-working on project ideas,
    with
the goal of having tangible results by the end of the week.
We welcome people interested in all kinds of time domain astronomy.
This project is designed to help build and support the broader Australian
    time domain community, including theorists and observers.

    <p>
    On the first day, we will have a "pitch session" in which participants will introduce their background,
    skills they may bring or want to learn, and any projects they may like to work on. We will then divide into
    groups based on interests and begin working on projects. The details of what these projects might look like
    are up to the participants attending! For example, groups who study stellar magnetic activity in the optical
    and radio may get together to combine observations and understand each others' data. Similarly,
    a group may form with the idea of preparing for first light discoveries with Rubin LSST connected
    to other surveys/teams in advance of first light in the first semester of 2025. It's up to you!

<h2>Schedule and Location</h2>

<p>
The <i>Australian Time Domain Astronomy Unconference</i> will take place September 2-6 2024
at the University of New South Wales.
</p>
    




<h2>Scientific Organizing Committee</h2>

<p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Nichole Barry</strong> (University of New South Wales, Co-Chair)</li>
    <li><strong>Adelle Goodwin</strong> (Curtin University)</li>
    <li><strong>Nandita Khetan</strong> (University of Queensland)</li>
    <li><strong>Anais M&#246;ller</strong> (Swinburne University of Technology)</li>
    <li><strong>Benjamin Montet</strong> (University of New South Wales, Co-Chair)</li>
    <li><strong>Bernhard Muller</strong> (Monash University)</li>
    <li><strong>Simon Murphy</strong> (University of Southern Queensland)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>

To ensure transparency and openness, we have adopted the
<a href="http://gaia.lol/codeofconduct.html">collaboration policy developed
for the Gaia Sprints</a>.
This policy requires that participants agree to the following:

</p><p>

All participants will be expected to openly share their ideas, expertise, code,
and interim results. Project development will proceed out in the open, among
participants and in the world.

</p><p>

Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new collaborations, and
combine projects. Any participant who contributes significantly to a project
can expect co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any participant
who gets significant contributions to a project is expected to include those
contributors as co-authors.

</p><p>

These rules make it <i>inadvisable to bring proprietary data sets or
proprietary code</i>, unless the participant bringing such assets has the
rights to open them or add collaborators.

</p>

<h2 id="codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate
harassment, abusive behavior, or intimidation of conference participants in any
form. As such, we follow the <a href="https://aas.org/ethics">AAS Code of
Ethics</a>, and expect all participants to read and abide by the statements
in the <a href="https://aas.org/ethics">AAS Code of Ethics</a>.
